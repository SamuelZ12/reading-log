Swapify: Community Trading & Skill Exchange Platform for University of Waterloo Students
The University of Waterloo’s dynamic student community faces challenges in accessing affordable skill development opportunities, monetizing hobbies, and building meaningful connections outside transactional relationships. Swapify addresses these pain points by creating a peer-to-peer platform where students can trade skills, services, and goods without monetary exchange, fostering collaboration, financial flexibility, and community trust. This document outlines the product’s vision, technical architecture, and roadmap to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) that aligns with the university’s ethos of innovation and inclusivity.

Product Vision and Strategic Alignment
Purpose and Objectives
Swapify’s primary objective is to empower students to leverage underutilized skills, reduce financial barriers to accessing services, and cultivate a cooperative ecosystem. By enabling skill trades—such as coding tutorials for graphic design assistance or textbook exchanges for meal prep services—the platform aligns with Waterloo’s strategic goals of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and enhancing student well-being. The MVP will prioritize core functionalities to validate demand, while future releases will expand monetization and community-building features.

Scope
The platform will serve 30,000+ Waterloo students initially, with scalability plans to include alumni, faculty, and local businesses. Phase 1 focuses on skill/service exchanges, while Phase 2 introduces barter-for-goods marketplaces and subcommunity creation tools. Compliance with Canadian privacy laws (PIPEDA) and university data policies is mandatory.

Target Audience and User Needs
Primary User Segments
Budget-Conscious Students: 68% of Waterloo students work part-time jobs to cover living expenses18. These users seek cost-effective ways to access tutoring, fitness coaching, or二手 textbooks.

Skill-Driven Entrepreneurs: Students with monetizable hobbies (e.g., photography, coding) lack platforms to trade expertise without formal freelancing overhead.

Clubs and Societies: Groups like Waterloo Blockchain4 require tools to coordinate skill-sharing workshops and resource exchanges.

International Students: 34% of Waterloo’s student body is international18; Swapify’s community focus aids cultural integration and reduces isolation.

Pain Points

No centralized platform for non-monetary trades, leading to fragmented peer arrangements.

Difficulty building trust in ad-hoc exchanges.
